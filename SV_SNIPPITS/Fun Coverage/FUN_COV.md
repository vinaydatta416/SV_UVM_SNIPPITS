Perfect 👍 — you pasted a **SystemVerilog functional coverage tutorial on transitions, ignore\_bins, and illegal\_bins**, with examples.
Now you want me to **explain each in detail**, step by step. Let’s go topic by topic with **concept, syntax, example, and explanation**.

# 📘 SystemVerilog Transition Bins & Special Bins (Detailed Explanation)

---

## 1. **Single Value Transition**

👉 Tracks a change from one specific value to another.

* **Syntax**: `<value1> => <value2>`
* **Meaning**: Bin is hit when the sampled variable changes from `value1` to `value2` on consecutive samples.

**Example**

```systemverilog
coverpoint data {
  bins b1 = (2 => 5);
  bins b2 = (2 => 10);
  bins b3 = (3 => 8);
}
```

* Bin `b1` records when `data` changes **2 → 5**.
* Bin `b2` records when `data` changes **2 → 10**.
* Bin `b3` records when `data` changes **3 → 8**.

---

## 2. **Sequence of Transitions**

👉 Tracks a **chain of consecutive value changes**.

* **Syntax**: `<v1> => <v2> => <v3> ...`

**Example**

```systemverilog
coverpoint data {
  bins b1 = (2 => 5 => 6);
  bins b2 = (2 => 10 => 12);
  bins b3 = (3 => 8 => 9 => 10);
}
```

* `b1`: covers **2 → 5 → 6**.
* `b2`: covers **2 → 10 → 12**.
* `b3`: covers **3 → 8 → 9 → 10**.
  ✅ Each transition must happen **back-to-back**.

---

## 3. **Set of Transitions**

👉 Covers all combinations between two sets of values.

* **Syntax**: `(set1 => set2)`

**Example**

```systemverilog
coverpoint data {
  bins b1[] = (2,3 => 4,5);
}
```

* Expands into 4 bins:

  * 2 → 4
  * 2 → 5
  * 3 → 4
  * 3 → 5

---

## 4. **Consecutive Repetition**

👉 Same value repeated **consecutively**.

* **Syntax**: `<value> [*repeat]`

**Example**

```systemverilog
coverpoint data {
  bins b1[] = (4[*3]);
}
```

* Equivalent to **4 → 4 → 4**.
* Bin is hit only if `data` stays at `4` for 3 consecutive samples.

---

## 5. **Range of Repetition**

👉 Repeated value within a given range.

* **Syntax**: `<value> [*min:max]`

**Example**

```systemverilog
coverpoint data {
  bins b1[] = (4[*2:4]);
}
```

* Expands to:

  * 4 → 4 (2 times)
  * 4 → 4 → 4 (3 times)
  * 4 → 4 → 4 → 4 (4 times)

---

## 6. **Goto Repetition**

👉 A value must repeat **exactly N times in sequence** before transitioning.

* **Syntax**: `<val1> => <val2[->N]> => <val3>`

**Example**

```systemverilog
coverpoint data {
  bins b1 = (2 => 5[->3] => 7);
}
```

* Must see:

  * 2 → 5 → 5 → 5 → 7
* `5` must appear **3 times in a row** before going to `7`.

---

## 7. **Non-Consecutive Repetition**

👉 A value must appear **N times, but not necessarily consecutively**.

* **Syntax**: `<val1> => <val2[=N]> => <val3>`

**Example**

```systemverilog
coverpoint data {
  bins b1 = (2 => 5[=3] => 7);
}
```

* Must see:

  * 2 … 5 … 5 … 5 … 7
* `5` must occur **3 times in total**, but can be separated by other values.
* ✅ More flexible than *goto repetition*.

---

## 🔑 Difference: Goto vs Non-Consecutive

* **Goto \[->N]**: Repetition must be **immediate and consecutive**.
* **Non-Consecutive \[=N]**: Value can repeat N times at **any spacing** before moving on.

---

## 8. **Ignore Bins**

👉 Exclude values or transitions from coverage.

* Useful when certain values are **don’t care** or irrelevant.

**Example**

```systemverilog
coverpoint addr {
  ignore_bins b1 = {1, 10, 12};
  ignore_bins b2 = {2 => 3 => 9};
}
```

* Ignores single values: 1, 10, 12.
* Ignores transition: **2 → 3 → 9**.
* ✅ These are **excluded** from coverage reports.

---

## 9. **Illegal Bins**

👉 Mark certain values or transitions as **illegal**.

* If hit during simulation → **runtime error reported**.

**Example**

```systemverilog
coverpoint addr {
  illegal_bins b1 = {1, 10, 12};
  illegal_bins b2 = {2 => 3 => 9};
}
```

* If `addr` = 1, 10, or 12 → ❌ Illegal coverage error.
* If transition **2 → 3 → 9** occurs → ❌ Error.
* ✅ Very useful to flag **design bugs**.
